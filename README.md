# Heartbeat of the city radar plot

**Radar plots** (also known as **polar** or **spider** plots) are extremely versatile. In the paper [The heartbeat of the city](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246714), authors show daily cyclic patterns in crime and crashes in Mexico City. One of the plots they present is a very informative **radar plot** showing differences in crime and crash rates **hourly** and throughout the **days of the week**, in a way that is visually appealing and easy to understand.

This [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/sofiapinto/Heartbeat-of-the-city-radar-plot/blob/main/Heartbeat%20of%20the%20city%20radar%20plot.ipynb) is a tutorial on how to do this type of radar plot in python. I used 2021 open data from New York City, [NYC crime data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243).
